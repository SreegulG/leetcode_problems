# Binary Search Insert Position in Python

This project provides an implementation of the "search insert position" algorithm using binary search. It efficiently finds the index where a target number should be located in a sorted array, or where it should be inserted to keep the order.

## Logic

- Initialize `start` and `end` pointers to define the search interval.
- While `start` is less than `end`:
  - Compute the middle index.
  - If the element at `mid` equals the target, return `mid`.
  - If it's less than the target, search the right half (move `start`).
  - If it's greater, search the left half (move `end`).
- When the loop ends, `start` indicates the correct position for insertion.

This gives logarithmic (**O(log n)**) time complexity.


## Features

- Efficient binary search approach for search and insert.
- Handles all integer values, including those not present in the list.
